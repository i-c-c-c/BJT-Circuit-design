# BJT-Circuit-design
The circuit in the image is a common-emitter amplifier. It contains V1, the input voltage source, providing the signal to be amplified. An NPN type of AC source is responsible for amplification. R1 and R2 these resistors sets the DC bias voltage at the base of the transistor. R3/Rc is the collector and R4/Re is the amplified one, and C1, C2 are capacitors that block DC while allowing the AC signal to pass.

In the graph the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents voltage. The graph shows the waveform is repeating, indicating a periodic signal. This suggests the circuit likely generates an oscillating output.

Notes:
The specific values of the components and the input signal will determine the gain and frequency response of the amplifier.
This README provides a basic description. Further analysis, such as calculating gain and bandwidth, can be performed based on the component values and simulation results. For, example, a PDF of the calculation was also added.
